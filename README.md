### An application that generates a shopping list based on selected culinary recipes.

https://dinner-react-app.netlify.app/ pass: mo

***Key features of the application:***

-Generates a shopping list based on selected recipes.
-The generated list contains a sum of ingredients from selected recipes divided into shopping categories.
-Ability to add custom recipes.
-While you're adding a recipe, you can define categories, ingredients, cookbooks, etc.
-This is a basic version of the application that I am continuously working on. Some of components still require refactoring.

Technologies used in the application:

-React
-Redux
-Firestore
-Formik + Yup
-Storybook
-Eslint, Prettier

**In the future, I plan to add the following to the application:**

- ~~Mobile version of the application~~
- Recipe editing
- User login with the ability to separate their own recipes
- ~~Shopping list memory (currently stored in context)~~
- ~~Ability to strike out products from the shopping list~~
- Ability to add additional products to the shopping list that are not related to recipes.
- Change propTypes to TypeScript
- Simplify getting data from Firebase
